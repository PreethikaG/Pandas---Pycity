# Pandas---Pycity

In this project, I used a dataset called "Academy of Py" to analyze, find trends and generate a report that helps make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. The 'Resources' folder contains the dataset used for this analysis. 

The following analysis were done : 

### District Summary

* Created high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics

### School Summary

* Created overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school 

### Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Created a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate 
  
### Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). 

### Scores by School Size

* Created  table that breaks down school performances based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large)


### Scores by School Type

* Created  table that breaks down school performances based on school type (Charter vs. District).

### Process Employed-

Reading the CSV in to a dataframe
Performing aggregate functions like sum,mean.
Bining data for finding school performance based size,type and average spending
Using loc,iloc functions to select a subset of the dataframe for analysis
Using Groupby function
Formatting the data in dataframe
